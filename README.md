# Gmail Contact Form

Very basic HTML contact form that uses Ajax and jQuery plugins to do client side verification and provide immediate feedback. Then sends form data to a php script that sanitizes the data and uses PHPmailer and Gmail to send that form data as an email. 

It should be noted that client side verification can be sidestepped entirely. If you intend to send confidential data you should also validate information on the server side.
